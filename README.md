ZendSkeletonApplication
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.

Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
    php composer.phar create-project -n -sdev zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install

Alternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git
    cd ZendSkeletonApplication
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)

Another alternative for downloading the project is to grab it via `curl`, and
then pass it to `tar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    curl -#L https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/tarball/master | tar xz --strip-components=1

You would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous
example.

Using Git submodules
--------------------
Alternatively, you can install using native git submodules:

    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git --recursive

Web Server Setup
----------------

### PHP CLI Server

The simplest way to get started if you are using PHP 5.4 or above is to start the internal PHP cli-server in the root directory:

    php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces.

**Note: ** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.

### Apache Setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName zf2-tutorial.localhost
        DocumentRoot /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
        <Directory /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public>
            DirectoryIndex index.php
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

### Vagrant

If you prefer to develop with Vagrant, there is a basic vagrant recipe included with this project.

This recipe assumes that you already have Vagrant installed. The virtual machine will try to use localhost:8080 by
default, so if you already have a server on this port of your host machine, you need to shut down the conflicting
server first, or if you know how, you can reconfigure the ports in Vagrantfile.

Assuming you have Vagrant installed and assuming you have no port conflicts, you can bring up the Vagrant machine
with the standard `up` command:

```
vagrant up
```

When the machine comes up, you can ssh to it with the standard ssh forward agent:

```
vagrant ssh
```

The web root is inside the shared directory, which is at `/vagrant`. Once you've ssh'd into the box, you need to cd:

```
cd /vagrant
```
