ZendSkeletonApplication
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.


Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
    php composer.phar create-project --repository-url="http://packages.zendframework.com" zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install

Alternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/ynunez/ZendSkeletonApplication.git
    cd ZendSkeletonApplication
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)

Another alternative for downloading the project is to grab it via `curl`, and
then pass it to `tar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    curl -#L https://github.com/ynunez/ZendSkeletonApplication/tarball/master | tar xz --strip-components=1

You would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous
example.

Using Git submodules
--------------------
Alternatively, you can install using native git submodules:

    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git --recursive

Virtual Host
------------
Virtual Host are not required with this modification, index.php has been moved to the root directory as well as the .htaccess file. Images, CSS, and JavaScript files still reside on the public directory and the base path has been set to the public directory
